# (Destiny) Arsenal

Like me you love Bungie's [Destiny](https://www.bungie.net/en/pub/AboutDestiny), but wish there were a little more RESTful ways to adjust your Guardian than the tools out there. Fear not, Arsenal is here to save your day.

Arsenal is a scala-backed Destiny API. All you need is your Xbox Live / Playstation Gamer ID and you are all set.

Still a work in progress tho.
